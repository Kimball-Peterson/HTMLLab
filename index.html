    <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>My name is Kimball Peterson. I am 24 years old from Midway, Utah. I moved to Midway as a junior in high school and finished up school and left on a mission from there. I spent time all over the US previous to my moving to Midway. I spent 6 years of my life in Texas in two different stints, one 4 years long and the other 2 years (the first two years of high school).</p>
    <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>I come from a family of 7. There are 5 of us kids. I am the oldest, with one younger brother and then three younger sisters. We are a tight knit group and love to spend time together. Everyone gets along well. Me and my brother have always been close, as we are so close in age. We spent our childhood doing anything and everything outdoors and always looked for adventures. My brother and I live together now in college and not much has changed.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>My hobbies include skiing, mountain biking, riding moto, surfing, and anything to do with cars. I have a passion for things that go fast! I've worked in the outdoors and sporting industries since I reached working age and have always had a passion for the gear associated with the activities I loved. Ive tried to become an expert in each of my fields of interest when it comes to hobbies. I don't know how to casually be involved in a sport and have thrown myself whole heartedly into most things Ive become involved in.</p>
